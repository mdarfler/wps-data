The barista is incredible, and frankly saves me a lot of time walking outside to a coffee place when I just need a break! It’s a beautiful building, the decor and furnishings are impeccable, and it makes me even more proud to work at BCG because I think it really shares how thoughtful and people-oriented we are as a firm. I do wish the meditation space were more inviting and less awkward — there’s one random chair, no cushions or options for sitting on the floor comfortably, and the way to use the space is unclear (do I lock the door if I’m the only one in there, do I book it just for myself, etc). I am surprised at how small the parking garage is — seems oddly short-sighted (totally recognize that was out of BCG’s control). But overall what gorgeous space we have!"

Open seating makes it very difficult for those that are in the office M-F.

The open seating also encourages informal conversations that carry on for 30-60 minutes at a time, disrupting work productivity. "

When people do talk to each other at their desks, you feel guilty. As a senior leader, I try to model that it is ok to talk to each other (and form a community), but it is an uphill battle.

I think we could potentially rotate out some of the healthy snacks on every floor. NY Office has flavored yogurts and some rotating fruits...maybe with whoever our suppliers are, we could get some sort of seasonal rotation deal or something like that.   I think we have enough meeting spaces, but sometimes the schedules get a bit wonky and it's difficult to get a room that appears open, but a team is squatting. That's probably more of an etiquette than a workspace question. Lastly, I have one of the newer laptops with a different power cord plug. This means that none of the workstations are enabled to charge my computer which is a bit frustrating to carry around my charger. Some of the partner offices do have this cord, but the workstations don't. I would appreciate an adapter if it exist that i could plug into the old charger or if cords could be installed sooner rather than later since all of the laptops will eventually be switched over in the coming years."

Improvements: I enjoy the open work space but I feel that my team should sit together when we are in the office, it is hard to collaborate because we do not have assigned desks/areas which often results in us not sitting near each other. It also takes me time to adapt to a new desk/area if I can't sit in my normal spot each day. I wish we could reserve desks and that peoples names were on a screen when they logged into a desk. As a new person there are a lot of people and this is helpful to get to know people and work with people. I also work with a lot of offices internationally and wish there was a phone with my number linked to it at my desk so I could make calls on the fly. Lastly, I do not like the new commuter boat. It has been fine in the evenings but the decreased frequency as compared to the buses in the morning has been challenging for my commute."

Need more trash and recycling bins, and would prefer better temperature control and the circle lights are distracting / headache inducing given the placement it would be helpful to be able to dim. I wish we could at least switch to biodegradable silverware or green options and paper straws if we’re not going to do away with single use plastic. From a work perspective not having a landline and using a virtual phone in an open concept is a non starter so we basically don’t have phones at all which is challenging when cell phones are not reimbursed below director. We have to pre schedule all meetings with any colleagues or advisors not in the office as a webex. It really slows down the pace of work when you eliminate those quick conversations."

You can't beat the convenience and the view!  I love the gym facilities and shower access provided.  The free coffee/tea/seltzer water are a great treat! There is great natural light in the office.  However, because everything is so open, it's like you're in a fishbowl.  I feel uncomfortable 90% of the time and I notice that people tend to be jumpy because they feel like they are always on display.  Instead of promoting collaboration, I think it promotes people to become more like hermits.  People are afraid to talk out in the open and the conference rooms are wide open so anyone can see what you are sharing in a private meeting.  I notice that a conference room will say it's open online but when I arrive, someone is sitting in there.  They are not either booking it or checking in when they arrive.  And I think this is because so many people are just seeking some privacy so they get up and walk to the nearest room.  The completely open seating with no ability to reserve a desk means that there have been times where I either don't get a desk at all or sit no where close to my team.  The alternative seating options provide terrible ergonomics and I cannot sit there for long periods of time.  Unfortunately, this has happened to me on multiple occasions as I do not believe that there are enough seats to account for everyone being in the office at the same time.  And in my section, people are in nearly every day.  It delays getting set up for your day.  Additionally, the personal lockers are too small and they should be taller to allow you to hang your jacket, bag, shoes and still allow room for files. I don't believe that the current open seating plan allows for employees to be as productive as they would like to be.          "

The idea is great but I am seeing more confidential material accidentally exposed here than I was in the old office -- because the printers aren't always stocked with paper, they don't give warnings when they are not stocked, and there is no obvious way to delete a job after it's been ""released"" -- so it comes out hours later when someone else puts paper in."

I'm tall, but if I stand and raise the desk and monitor, the monitor shakes so much it's distracting. Telephone rooms are fantastic idea, with very terrible audio quality and even worse lighting if you use WebEx. There's almost no sound dampening in them, and the lighting is so bright that WebEx looks unprofessional to those on the receiving end. I'm also surprised at the amount of litter and junk that's around after only ~6 months. Some of this is up to individual employees and groups, not BCG or office services, but I do think a LOT more can be done to keep this office clean and tidy. "

Some areas for improvement are 1. Finding break out rooms to take calls/meetings can be difficult. Part of the reason is that I often see the same person staying in the same office for days or weeks, using it for the entire work day as their personal office. This takes away resources for the rest and is not what I expect the space how it should be used. This is more of a culture change or a few bad apples, but it happens daily. 2. The vestibule card readers are not good at isolating my access card when it is in my wallet. I keep my access card in my wallet with other RFID cards (e.g., charlie card). The readers are not good at identifying and isolating the 1 card if it reads both. I have to take out the card and from the wallet for it to register, which happens every time I use the bathroom or elevator.

Many people just camp out in the small meetings rooms all day without even booking the room. Its frustrating when you need to find a room to attend a video call. The alternative is to take it from your desk out in the open floor and risk annoying others. 2) The continuous construction noise (outside beeping) has given me headaches on more than one occasion. I have been avoiding the office the past few weeks because of this.

The care and consideration given to so many components reaffirms my belief that BCG cares about the people and the employee experience and Pier 4 largely supports that.  The teams involved in making Pier 4 an incredible place to work are best in class, truly.  We are so fortunate for the teams who support the office environment and experience. We have some improvement needed to support different types of work in GS, namely the privacy and the need for quiet zones to support thinking and work which requires analysis and review. Quiet zones and more offices and workspaces with frosted glass would be useful. The open offices to allow natural light are fit for that purpose but may have created too much visual stimulation leading to distractions in meetings and focused work. Very few offices and workstations have privacy - not all need to be completely frosted but just a bit more privacy would offset the visual stimulation created by the ""fishbowl"".  The monitors at workstations offer zero privacy, so when I could be working at a workstation instead of a bookable workspace, I find myself booking a resources because there is no privacy. My work absolutely requires confidentiality for many reasons. A/V equipment is top notch, needs some work to be compatible and user-friendly.  progress made in this area has been great the last few months - keep it up! I'm sad we don't have dishes to use - we are creating so much unnecessary waste, seemingly because we don't trust people to put dishes in the dishwasher.  Let's fix the culture and create personal accountability to the workspace instead of wasting money and resources on the disposable plates and utensils. Set a standard to facilitate this and signage so there are ""no excuses"" for not putting items in the dishwasher. Example, ""Dirty dishes belong in the dishwashers to the left and right of the sink. Thank you for keeping our workspace clean"". To that end, move the eating materials (cutlery and plates/bowls) to the ""back kitchen"" zones where the employee refrigerators are located so that we can prepare and grab food from the same area instead of needing to walk back & forth between kitchen areas, creating traffic and inefficiencies. Personal locker space should be improved. Most commute and need to change shoes, etc. - lockers are not large enough to support the Boston weather or commute options. I'd pay for extra, dedicated space which would make my am/pm feel like less of a hiking expedition and more like a normal work commute. I use my tiny locker to store the real dishes I use to eat lunch and shoes, leaving little room for anything else.  Please, please, please lobby for curtains in dressing areas in the locker rooms so we are not forced to run into half-naked colleagues - it's less than ideal on so many levels. Desk booking would be nice, given the actual desk space is limited. I don't like the notion of creating classes of citizens but seeing co-ops and temps/contractors at the workstations and working in office whilst tenured and senior folks are hunching over laptops at a barstool can be frustrating. Managers should be encouraged to set some working space norms for their teams and employee types. In light of the growth, I'm worried about future capacity for the productive workspace options."

The culture at BCG is such that although we have open seating, people don't talk to others sitting next to them. We may have moved offices but the culture still doesn't seem to have changed much. Also, from an environmental perspective, the office still uses a lot of paper cups for beverages. We need glasses and mugs to reduce this. Our environmental impact is high. During winter time, it would be nice for us to be able to leave our work shoes etc. in larger spaces. The current lockers are too small for winter storage. These are small suggestions.

The walk over the bridge can be brutal on very cold days) THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU DO!!!"

Love the stand-up sit-down desks and over-sized monitors with privacy screens- I really think the large monitors have greatly improved my efficiency at work to the point where BCG is going to start making a financial return on investment for employee efficiency. 3. Love the lighthouse staircase how it connects the three offices within BCG – that is so huge in breaking barriers and making a community feel-- Things we can work to improve—1. Can we increase our sustainability measures in the office by reducing single use serving utensils (plastic forks, cups, ect), increase recycling, buy local/organic when possible ect. 2.  I highly dislike not having a dedicated work space for many reasons including- extra time to get set up and close down every day, sterile looking and feeling work environment, no character, I want to spend less time in the office because I do not feel connected without personal touch (photos, paper calendar, plant, holiday decorations, ect). Many people sit in the same seats every day anyways which defeats part of the reason for having open seating and makes it uncomfortable for some people to sit at a work station that has been unofficially claimed by someone else. Honestly, it's very inconvenient to not have a dedicated space to work when you come into the office 5 days a week- it really makes me prefer to work from home whenever possible instead of spending over two hours total time commuting each day to have no dedicated space at the office. Can we please have an opt-in assigned work station policy for people who really want it? Maybe it’s temporary assigned stations that switch up every couple months to increase affiliation and allow for adjusting with flexing workforce size. On that topic- please increase personal and team storage space. My small locker barely fits a couple pairs of shoes and extra sweater—let alone any work materials. If we really cannot have dedicated work stations for people who come into the office 5 days a week, it would be great to at least have enough space to securely store more things so we do not have to constantly carry them back and forth on our commutes (my 2.5 hour daily commute involves multiple modes of transport due office location distance from main public transit). One last thing- the water has had an off-taste recently (like chlorine or slimy), has it been tested recently/is it safe to drink large quantities of it? Is it filtered? Can we please filter if it is not already? Thank you for your interest in our thoughts and for giving us the opportunity to provide feedback on our working environment!"

A bigger table in that space would be welcome - right now the biggest table only seats four, but a nice long table to the right of the staircase would be perfect. The change to reusable mugs was good, but now instead of throwing away coffee cups we're throwing away paper towels whenever we clean our mugs - dishwashers, drying racks, or cloth towels would be better. Also flavored yoghurt - I love Chobani, but not plain... Finally, I'm concerned about people with peanut allergies - with a shared workspace like what we have, I think we need some signage or reminders that if you are eating peanut butter, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before using shared equipment like a mouse or keyboard. People should do that anyway, but they need to think about it as not just a courtesy but a safety issue."

Also appreciate that there is plenty of space for meeting and huddle rooms, as well as great service from the reception team in assisting with room bookings, etc. The cafe and stairway area is great in fostering a conducive environment for catch-ups and affiliation (both planned meetings as well as unintentionally bumping into others in the common areas!) Appreciate the floor plans by the elevators that help guide us to the right rooms as well. Overall, love the space but have two suggestions for improvement: (1) can we reduce the environmental impact we are having by reducing the number of disposables we use, especially in the kitchen? (2) can we remind people that the mudroom cubby holes are not for overnight use and shouldn't be ""reserved"" - there are items that appear to be left there for many days (ie. I see them late at night when I leave and again in the early AM when I arrive) and sometimes there's no more space left. Overall though, love the space and thanks for making it happen!"
